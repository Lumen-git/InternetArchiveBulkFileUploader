# InternetArchiveBulkFileUploader
Upload all files of a given type from a source folder to the Internet Archive


To begin, make sure the Internet Archive python package is installed.

Open the program in a text edit program and change the values at the top for collection, type, source, destination, and file extention. Run the program and it will upload all the files it can and move them to a sub folder so they don't get reuploaded if the script is ran again.
